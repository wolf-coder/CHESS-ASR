#+title: Chess-ASR

- A solution for playing chess on Lichess using speech-to-text technology.
- The solution is developed using Vosk, Selenium, Lichess API, and Chess-python.
* Important notes
- This project represents an MVP step in the development of a desktop/mobile application that will implement various machine learning solutions and features for the game of chess. One of these features will be an ASR model allowing users to dictate their `moves` instead of writing them down with the keyboard or using the mouse.

- The solution should be working fine with [[https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip][vosk-model-small-en-us]]. However, for our =chess-finetuned= model , you should contact me.
